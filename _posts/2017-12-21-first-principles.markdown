> First principles thinking is the act of boiling a process down to the fundamental parts that you know are true and building up from there.

> Imagine you have three things:
> A motorboat with a skier behind it
> A military tank
> A bicycle
>
> Now, let's break these items down into their constituent parts:
> Motorboat: motor, the hull of a boat, and a pair of skis.
> Tank: metal treads, steel armor plates, and a gun.
> Bicycle: handlebars, wheels, gears, and a seat.
>
> What can you create from these individual parts? One option is to make a snowmobile by combining the handlebars and seat from the bike, the metal treads from the tank, and the motor and skis from the boat.
>
> This is the process of first principles thinking in a nutshell. It is a cycle of breaking a situation down into the core pieces and then putting them all back together in a more effective way. Deconstruct then reconstruct.

I find this 100% fascinating.

I also wonder if this is how kids learn and are so creative. I’ve observed my son see the parts of objects because he doesn’t have a preconceived notion of the whole. Makes me wonder if we need to relearn how to learn.
