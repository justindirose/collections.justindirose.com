> God now no longer deals with sin, having accomplished that end in the finished work of Christ. Now He is solely occupied with our righteousness.

> We do not become new persons by changing our behavior. We discover the person we already are in Christ and behave accordingly.

> We must stop focusing on our actions in our struggle to figure out our identity. We must find out from our Father and Creator what our true identity is, and then we must walk out our actions in accordance with that identity.

> The Church has traded the selfish focus of lust for a self-focused search for personal freedom. Personal freedom will be found when we focus on freedom for others. When you see a beautiful and possibly tempting woman, immediately switch your focus to praying protection over her. Don’t turn inward and battle temptation; turn outward and place yourself in prayer as a protector. This identity shift will renew your mind and bring personal freedom as an inadvertent by-product.

> The fact is that men will always notice beautiful women; God made those beautiful women and gave men the ability to visually appreciate that beauty. That alone is not sinful. The fact that you notice and appreciate beautiful women is not a bad thing. You have crossed the line into dangerous territory once you become selfish with what you are seeing.
