>"Many have pursued greater productivity via books or apps, expecting information or technology alone to make them more productive. These initially feel helpful, but then, usually, they fail. The problem is that becoming more productive is more like losing weight than memorizing the presidents’ names – it is the product of behavior or lifestyle change, not (only) knowledge. As a result, the key to becoming more productive is changing small behaviors (i.e., developing new habits) and sticking with those changes over time."

>"In fact, as recently as 2012, a Gallup poll revealed that 40% of U.S. workers “were so stressed out they felt burnt out.” Stress and anxiety are cited in 70% of the calls placed to phone-counseling lines at Workplace Options, a provider of employee-assistance programs. This may not be too surprising since working hours continue to climb for the highest paid workers. In the last 30 years, the multi-century trend of the best-paid workers working less than the lowest-paid workers has been turned on its head. Today, the best paid are about twice as likely to work long hours as the most poorly paid. According to a 2008 survey, the vast majority of professionals (94%) worked 50 hours or more a week, and almost half worked more than 65 hours a week."
