Author: James Goll

> Sometimes insisting on having a breakthrough in any area of our lives just reveals the presence of our human impatience.

p. 29

> You and I do not originate kingdom decisions or initiate kingdom actions.

p. 56

> I recommend setting aside a special time annually for a personal heart checkup. Pray over the condition of your heart and immerse yourself in the Word. Ask for restoration and renewal, praying “Create in me a clean heart o God."

p. 74

> When you ask God for help, personalize it: “Lord, I lack ______. You have a vast supply, and it has been made available to me through Jesus Christ.” Be specific. Rest in the assurance that He has heard you. Wait patiently and believingly with openness and receptivity.

p. 103

> [Daniel and his friends’] exceptional level of knowledge and intelligence was a pure gift from God.

p. 106

> Also, do not forget about the importance of having rest and peace. You can’t serve God at a frantic pace for very long, and your internal noise will drown out His quiet voice. Knowings will float to the surface only if you are not splashing around, afraid of drowning due to your circumstances. God is much bigger than any issue you may ever face, and He is not worried at all. He does not have sweaty palms; He is not wringing his hands in heaven, fretting over the lack of solutions. Again, heaven’s revelation brings hope solutions to earth’s problems.

p. 108

> Learn the moment by moment assessment process, but also observe the kind of fruit that grows over time.

p. 118-119

> Your end-time worldview will determine your lifestyle.

p. 173

## Biggest Takeaways

* Discernment is a process. Embrace it in whole surrender to the Lord. 
* Discernment is not only seeing and feeling (like I once thought it), but it’s receiving the communication of the spiritual realm AND being able to tell what is from the Lord and what is not.
* Rest and peace are crucial to being able to discern correctly.
* All actions in the Kingdom are originated from God in a place of submission to Him.
