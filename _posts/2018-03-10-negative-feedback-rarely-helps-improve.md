>  "Should we bookend negative feedback with positive feedback, then?  No. That’s not a great strategy. It’s not about itemizing the feedback and saying, “You did this well. You do this poorly. You did this well. You do this poorly.” It’s about accompanying negative feedback with validation of who people are and of their value to the organization. And it’s not even about providing it all the time. People just need to feel valued."

Amen. It's not about praise, it's about people knowing they are cared about. As people. Not as producers.
