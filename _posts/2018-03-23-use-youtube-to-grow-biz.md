> "In other words, it doesn’t matter how many views you get; what matters is how long people watch your videos for.  That has dramatic implications for content creators.  For example, people used to only create short videos because they didn’t want to scare away viewers with videos that were 20 minutes long.  That doesn’t matter anymore: now the way to win is to have longer, higher-quality videos that keep viewers’ attention for as long as possible.  YouTube actually makes this easy by telling you the “% watch time” for each of your videos."

> "YouTube really likes and rewards serialized content.  They are fighting Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Hulu for your eyeballs so they can make more money on advertising.  So they want to keep people binge watching on YouTube as long as they can.  This is why YouTube rewards videos that are in playlists.  Think about it: YouTube wants to maximize viewership, and people are more likely to continue watching videos in a playlist than bounce around from one video to another."

> "Having over 30 million views and 380,000+ subscribers on YouTube doesn’t mean jack squat  The secret is converting those views into subscribers on my email list – that’s where the money is.  What we want to do is grow a big YouTube following so we can be seen by more people, but only so we can move them from YouTube land to our email lists.  Once there, we can offer them more free content and of course our products and services."
